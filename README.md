### Hi there 👋

I am **Sagnol kamdem** young developer 😄, curious, particularly attracted by the UI ✨, I specialized in the front-end. I also have other assets, in particular my love for coding, which makes me capable and ready to take up new challenges ⚡.

### About my knowledge 👨‍🎓

Aware of the rapid evolution and the constant release of new technologies, I do not cease to question myself and from there, I have developed a particular skill of **learning to learn** and since then, I have not stopped improving.
